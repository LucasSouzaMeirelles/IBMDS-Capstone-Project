1.SpaceX is known for operating low-cost rocket launches, and that is partially due to their being able to retrieve stage one rocket boosters more consistently than their competitors.  
2.Given the importance of the aforementioned competitive edge, the project here presented aims at delivering a model that can predict the binary outcome, success or failure, of the landing operation of stage one rocket boosters with reasonable accuracy.
3.Summary of methodologies: The project followed the usual steps of a data science project, namely, data collection, data wrangling, exploratory analysis and visualizations and, finally, predictive model development.  
4.Summary of all results: Logistic Regression proved to be the most adequate approach to the problem in question. The projectâ€™s final product, a Logistic Regression-based model, boasts an accuracy score of 83%.
